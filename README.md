# vuemaps

A Vue.js library for interactive map APIs.

## Mapbox 

The Mapbox components require a [Mapbox access token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/). You can provide that to Mapbox in the demo app by creating a `.env.local` file in the root of the directory and setting `VUE_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN` to your token.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

There's a demo application at `src/App.vue` which gives use case examples. To view it: 

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

The build process targets a [library](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/build-targets.html#library) and **does not inline Vue.js**.

```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
